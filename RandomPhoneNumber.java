Write an application that creates and prints a random phone
number of the form
the output. Do not let the first three digits contain an 8 or 9
(but donâ€™t be more restrictive than that), and make sure that the
second set of three digits is not greater than 742. Hint: Think
through the easiest way to construct the phone number. Each
digit does not have to be determined separately.
